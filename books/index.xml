      <description>Here is a list of books that I have read and liked.
Books from Ted Chiang The Merchant and the Alchemist&amp;rsquo;s
Exhalation
The Lifecycle of Software Objects
The Great Silence
Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom
Tower of Babylone
Understand
Division by Zero
Story of Your Life
Hell is the Absence of God
I enjoy reading Ted Chiang a lot, maybe I get that from liking tech related stuff. Ted Chiang likes to take his inspiration from Scientific Topics, and most usually come from complex ones.</description>
