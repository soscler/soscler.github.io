One good thing I also like from of his books, they are short and can be read in one night or longer if you are a slow reader like me.\nI liked Story of Your Life and Others a lot. I had watched the movie Arrival a long time before getting to know it was from Ted’s Chaing book. The movie was really good, and unlike many Sci-Fi movies, I felt like this had more realism into it. I could easily relate the langage as an obstacle in understanding each other and creating a good relationship. Also in the movie the Aliens where not seen as foreign entities coming and creating wars and gathering all goods they can get from the locals, instead their objective was more subtle, unknown I would say. Until the end I didn’t get the purpose of the Aliens coming on Earth. I still believe there should be a follow up. But many told me it didn’t feel like there should be.\nLong after watching the movie, I got to read the book Story of Your Life and Other on a recommentation of my girlfriend. After reading the book I was so surprised on how the movie reflected as almost as perfect the story in the book.\nWhat mental pictures do I create from books\nDevotion of the Suspect X This book didn’t have many characters in it so it was relatively easier to keep track of people faces I created in my mind. But what strikes me until today and after 3 years, is how I still have some mental pictures of scenes in my mind.For example this scene where the main characther walks by a bridge where homeless people gathered. Something intense related to that scene would happen later, but I will not talk about that here.\nAu revoir la haut In this book about World War I, I mostly create mental pictures of the main characthers. The Author is so descriptive in his writting that creating metal pictures is so easily. One strange sensation I never got from no other book is a mental odour, or perfume. At one point in the book the author where described how an injured soldiers wounds started to rot and I can tell you I almost got a mental smell from that. I am not even sure if mental smell is a thing but I sensed something.\nMemoirs from a Geisha While reading this book, I was mostly able to pictures the clothings. A great focus was put on the clothings by the author, as Kimonos takes a great place and value in a Geisha life. When the other gives small details and sometime link these details to greater things in the nature like a forest or river, I easily pictured how the clothes looked like.\nI have already seen some pictures from Japan with Cherry Blossoming, Pink flowers on the snow. I also saw many pictures about Zen culture (Bamboo, Water flowing, etc.). Finally I watched lot of Japanese animes.\nUsually when I read a book I create mental images of the story, characters, houses, clothes, etc.\n","wordCount":"607","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-21T23:52:44+01:00","dateModified":"2022-12-21T23:52:44+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chriss Santi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://soscler.github.io/books/book-i-have-read/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"It's Osler","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://soscler.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://soscler.github.io accesskey=h title="It's Osler (Alt + H)">It's Osler</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://soscler.github.io/photos/ title=Photos><span>Photos</span></a></li><li><a href=https://soscler.github.io/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://soscler.github.io/books/ title=Reading><span>Reading</span></a></li><li><a href=https://soscler.github.io/posts/about-me/ title="About me"><span>About me</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://soscler.github.io>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://soscler.github.io/books/>Books</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Book I Have Read<sup><span class=entry-isdraft>&nbsp;&nbsp;[draft]</span></sup></h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-21 23:52:44 +0100 +0100'>December 21, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Chriss Santi</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#books-from-ted-chiang aria-label="Books from Ted Chiang">Books from Ted Chiang</a><ul><li><a href=#devotion-of-the-suspect-x aria-label="Devotion of the Suspect X">Devotion of the Suspect X</a></li><li><a href=#au-revoir-la-haut aria-label="Au revoir la haut">Au revoir la haut</a></li><li><a href=#memoirs-from-a-geisha aria-label="Memoirs from a Geisha">Memoirs from a Geisha</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h1 id=heading><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#heading>#</a></h1><p>Here is a list of books that I have read and liked.</p><h2 id=books-from-ted-chiang>Books from Ted Chiang<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#books-from-ted-chiang>#</a></h2><ul><li><p>The Merchant and the Alchemist&rsquo;s</p></li><li><p>Exhalation</p></li><li><p>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</p></li><li><p>The Great Silence</p></li><li><p>Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom</p></li><li><p>Tower of Babylone</p></li><li><p>Understand</p></li><li><p>Division by Zero</p></li><li><p>Story of Your Life</p></li><li><p>Hell is the Absence of God</p></li></ul><p>I enjoy reading Ted Chiang a lot, maybe I get that from liking tech related stuff.
