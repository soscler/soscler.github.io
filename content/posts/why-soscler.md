My full name is Chriss Osler Santi. Taking few letters in each of my name I formed soscler. **S**anti**O**slerchris**SC**hrisos**LER**.\
A bit more to the story. Back home in Burkina Faso there is a stew called Sauce Claire (Clear Stew) and you eat it with rice. When pronounced in French, Sauce Claire is a bit close to Osler.
And because I have a light skin, which you say in French Teint Clair (Clear Complexion), one of my friend instead of calling me Osler liked to call me Sauce Claire.

Putting it together, I thought that soscler was more appropriate as a nickname.
