I spent all my school year from elementary school until highshool at the same place.
From those years, nothing could best play time. In elementary shool We get 25 mins break, from 9h45 to 10h10 and for the grown ups it was 20 mins. Most if not all the time I will get out of the classroom, sometimes to get a snack and juice with my friend, other times, just to play.

During elementary school we liked to play random games we just created. I remember for example a games where we pick someone as a bus driver and everyone else just run to get into the bus, but the driver won't stop and let you catch him, so you keep running to get to the bus. I think you can say it's similar to the tag game.
When I was about 10-14 I like to do jump stunts or do break dance with classmates during pause time. A bit older I shifted my attention away and mostly enjoyed sepending the time talking about random stuff with my friends.

I didn't like studying but my parents like kids who study a lot. At home they wanted to see me with copybooks at least from 7 to 9-10PM. And dare you if you fell asleep while sutdying.
For me, I always thought that listening to what the teacher said during the class was more important and I try to make mental picture of that. When I really needed I will focus on reading before the tests, but I always found it hard to study long before the test.

Only my last year of high school I got a bit more serious and like every one else I started to study long before the final exam. But you know, I did it because everyone was saying the last exam before university is so damn hard, and for me failling was not an option. My parents like kids that study a lot.
But even then I couldn't stay too long in front of my copybooks.
If you're reading this, don't get me wrong and not study beforehand. I did homeworks that was asked at school. Of course I never sacrificed my weekends to do them. I will always do them a day or two before the class but I still did them. A nice felling at school is when you get your homework right and get to go to the board and solve it for the whole class.

As time went on, what I like about subjects changed. In elementary school, I liked drawing and natural science (Biology, Earth). In college, I sitll liked natural sciences (Living and non Living), but I still didn't like Maths. When we started Physics and Chemistry, I told myself I had to like it, because I always heard my older siblings talk about it and I felt like I was missing out.
I only started to like Maths in my 4th year of college. The story that lead to that is a bit dramatic and I will skip that.
In High school, same scenario, I started to study Philosphy and I told myseld I had to like because of me finally getting in the grown up closed circle.
As a matter of fact I liked Philosophy a lot, I also like continued liking Physics, Chemistry and Maths and that helped me a lot in putting more focus during class. Finally I never stopped liking natural science. I hardly failed one test about genetics which hit me hard than I thought, because natural science has always been my greatest point.
I liked sports, it's outdoor.

I didn't like History and Geography. These two subject where given by the same teacher. I think maybe that not liking history as lead me to not like Geography.
When I went to university I thought to myself that they don't teach us history properly.
I didn't like French classes, especially in elementary school, I couldn't grasp it to how other kids could understant all these difficult things about coordination, relative subjects, especially this one.
I was not good in English and I didn't like it either, I felt like the only thing I learnt from English is a long list of verbs.
