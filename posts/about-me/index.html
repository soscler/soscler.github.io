I beleive it’s the biggest neighborhood in Ouagadougou.\nI went to kindergarden for two years and then unlike most people back home, I spent all my school years at the same school called Sainte Famille. You know when your parents hear that this school near by is one of the best in town (I mean at that time), you end up like me.\nAs a child I liked tech related stuff, tv, games, social experiences and being outside. I would spend all my library time at school reading about Telescopes and Astronomy. I was always fascinated by the countodown of NASA rockets launches, 10, 9, 8… and like many kids my age, I dreamed to become, a pilot, a doctor, an astronaut.\nPimp my ride dream I liked watching TV specially cartoons, animes and TV shows. I would always sneak at one of my friend’s house after school to watch Dragon Ball Z, Totally Spies, Ninja Trurtles or whatever was going on the TV. Some of my friends were amongst what you will call cool/rich kids, so they always have great TV channels. You remember this show called Pimp My Ride on MTV ? Yeah I loved that. Yhup I read somewhere that it was a scam, but man, they gave hope and joy to so many. At home I loved wathching Zoro, Robin des bois, C’est Pas Sorcier on the Black and White Cathod TV we owned. We plugged it on battery and damn these cathod TV consumes lot of energy. The worst feeling was when you were watching a great show and then the battery (dies) runs out of energy.\nFirst PS2 experience Games where same as TV, I owned a Brick Game on which I played Tetris a lot, Snake and other retro games. The screen was pixelited and Black and White. I also played other games like Sonic, Mario on Sega, Game Cube, Game Boy, Wii, PS1, Nitendo DS, PS2, PSP all at my friends’. I remember that one time where one of my friend dad was coming back from France and promised my friend he will bring him a PS2. Damn the wait, the joy it was all shared between our group. Then the day came, my friend dad came a Friday evening, and as you recall back in elementary school we didn’t have class on Saturday. But man! I had to see and play this PS2. Of course my parents wouldn’t just let me go to my friend’s house to play (…). I am sorry, but I told them that they asked us to come to school this special Saturday. Man! they didn’t believe, but which parent at that time will call the school to check? NONE. So I spent the whole day at my friend’s playing Burnout, it’s a racing game and also Football. He also got a karaoke game. But we didn’t touch that much, his sister liked it I think. But here’s the catch, you know they say that when you lie you end up lying more to cover your initial lie. For me I was so deeply versed in the game and joy, that I forgot to go home at lunch time and man! the sun sets quickly when you don’t look at it. I don’t remember if I got beat up when I got home, but that was so common, I wouldn’t be surprised.\nI like people You should have got it by now that I was always with friends. And this continues until now. I have always had someone to talk with, to play football, to play in the school playgroung, to do jump tricks (stunts) in the sand, to study, to play video games, to go look out for girls, to go to church. And now that I think about it, it’s funny because they were different people most of the time.\n","wordCount":"695","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-20T22:57:09+01:00","dateModified":"2022-12-20T22:57:09+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chriss Santi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://soscler.github.io/posts/about-me/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"It's Osler","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://soscler.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://soscler.github.io accesskey=h title="It's Osler (Alt + H)">It's Osler</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://soscler.github.io/posts/about-me/ title="About me"><span class=active>About me</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://soscler.github.io>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://soscler.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>About Me<sup><span class=entry-isdraft>&nbsp;&nbsp;[draft]</span></sup></h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-20 22:57:09 +0100 +0100'>December 20, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Chriss Santi</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#ne-yii-beogo aria-label="Ne yii beogo">Ne yii beogo</a><ul><li><a href=#bonjour-tout-le-monde aria-label="Bonjour tout le monde">Bonjour tout le monde</a><ul><li><a href=#hi-all aria-label="Hi all">Hi all</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href=#childhood aria-label=Childhood>Childhood</a><ul><li><a href=#pimp-my-ride-dream aria-label="Pimp my ride dream">Pimp my <del>ride</del> dream</a></li><li><a href=#first-ps2-experience aria-label="First PS2 experience">First PS2 experience</a></li><li><a href=#i-like-people aria-label="I like people">I like people</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=ne-yii-beogo>Ne yii beogo<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ne-yii-beogo>#</a></h2><h3 id=bonjour-tout-le-monde>Bonjour tout le monde<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bonjour-tout-le-monde>#</a></h3><h4 id=hi-all>Hi all<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hi-all>#</a></h4><p>I am Chriss Santi, your random guy which happen to be a software developer and living in the French Alps.</p><h2 id=childhood>Childhood<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#childhood>#</a></h2><p>I was born in Ouagadougou, it&rsquo;s the capital of Burkina Faso and I grew up in a neighborhood called Pissy.
