[{"content":"Ne yii beogo Bonjour tout le monde Hi all I am Chriss Santi, your random guy which happen to be a software developer and living in the French Alps.\nChildhood I was born in Ouagadougou, it\u0026rsquo;s the capital of Burkina Faso and I grew up in a neighborhood called Pissy. I beleive it\u0026rsquo;s the biggest neighborhood in Ouagadougou.\nI went to kindergarten for two years and then unlike most people back home, I spent all my school years at the same school called Sainte Famille. You know when your parents hear that this school near by is one of the best in town (I mean at that time), you end up like me.\nAs a child I liked tech related stuff, tv, games, social experiences and being outside. I would spend all my library time at school reading about Telescopes and Astronomy. I was always fascinated by the countodown of NASA rockets launches, 10, 9, 8\u0026hellip; and like many kids my age, I dreamed to become, a pilot, a doctor, an astronaut.\nPimp my ride dream I liked watching TV specially cartoons, animes and TV shows. I would always sneak at one of my friend\u0026rsquo;s house after school to watch Dragon Ball Z, Totally Spies, Ninja Trurtles or whatever was going on the TV. Some of my friends were amongst what you will call cool/rich kids, so they always have great TV channels. You remember this show called Pimp My Ride on MTV? Yeah I loved that. Yes! I read somewhere that it was a scam, but man! they gave hope and joy to so many. At home I loved wathching Zoro, Robin des bois, C\u0026rsquo;est Pas Sorcier on the Black and White Cathod TV we owned. We plugged it on battery, but these brick TV consume lot of energy. The worst feeling was when you were watching a great show and then the battery runs out of energy.\nFirst PS2 experience Games where same as TV, I owned a Brick Game on which I played Tetris a lot, Snake and other retro games. The screen was pixelated Black and White. I also played other games like Sonic, Mario on Sega, Game Cube, Game Boy, Wii, PS1, Nitendo DS, PS2, PSP all at my friends\u0026rsquo;. I remember that one time where one of my friend dad was coming back from France and promised my friend he will bring him a PS2. The wait! The joy! it was all shared between our group. Then the day came and of all days, my friend dad came a Friday evening. As you recall back in elementary school we didn\u0026rsquo;t have class on Saturday. Look! I had to see and play this PS2. Of course my parents wouldn\u0026rsquo;t just let me go to my friend\u0026rsquo;s house to play (\u0026hellip;). I told them that they asked us to come to school this special Saturday. They didn\u0026rsquo;t believe, but which parent at that time will call the school to check? NONE. So I spent the whole day at my friend\u0026rsquo;s playing Burnout, it\u0026rsquo;s a racing game, we also played Football. He got a karaoke game as well. But we didn\u0026rsquo;t touch that much. But here\u0026rsquo;s the catch, you know they say that when you lie you end up lying more to cover your initial lie. For me I was so deeply versed in the game and joy, that I forgot to go home at lunch time. The sun sets quickly when you don\u0026rsquo;t look at it. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember if I got beat up when I got home, but that was so common, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised.\nI like people You should have got it by now that I was always with friends. And this continues until now. I have always had someone to talk with, to play football, to play in the school playground, to do jump tricks (stunts) in the sand, to study, to play video games, to go look out for girls, to go to church. And now that I think about it, it\u0026rsquo;s funny because they were different people most of the time.\n","permalink":"https://soscler.github.io/posts/about-me/","summary":"Take a glimpse in my childhood!","title":"About Me"},{"content":"My full name is Chriss Osler Santi. Taking few letters in each of my name I formed soscler. SantiOslerchrisSChrisosLER.\nA bit more to the story. Back home in Burkina Faso there is a stew called Sauce Claire (Clear Stew) and you eat it with rice. When pronounced in French, Sauce Claire is a bit close to Osler. And because I have a light skin, which you say in French Teint Clair (Clear Complexion), one of my friend instead of calling me Osler liked to call me Sauce Claire.\nPutting it together, I thought that soscler was more appropriate as a nickname.\n","permalink":"https://soscler.github.io/posts/why-soscler/","summary":"The reason of using soscler as a nickname","title":"Why Soscler?"},{"content":"I spent all my school year from elementary school until highshool at the same place. From those years, nothing could best play time. In elementary shool We get 25 mins break, from 9h45 to 10h10 and for the grown ups it was 20 mins. Most if not all the time I will get out of the classroom, sometimes to get a snack and juice with my friend, other times, just to play.\nDuring elementary school we liked to play random games we just created. I remember for example a games where we pick someone as a bus driver and everyone else just run to get into the bus, but the driver won\u0026rsquo;t stop and let you catch him, so you keep running to get to the bus. I think you can say it\u0026rsquo;s similar to the tag game. When I was about 10-14 I like to do jump stunts or do break dance with classmates during pause time. A bit older I shifted my attention away and mostly enjoyed sepending the time talking about random stuff with my friends.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t like studying but my parents like kids who study a lot. At home they wanted to see me with copybooks at least from 7 to 9-10PM. And dare you if you fell asleep while sutdying. For me, I always thought that listening to what the teacher said during the class was more important and I try to make mental picture of that. When I really needed I will focus on reading before the tests, but I always found it hard to study long before the test.\nOnly my last year of high school I got a bit more serious and like every one else I started to study long before the final exam. But you know, I did it because everyone was saying the last exam before university is so damn hard, and for me failling was not an option. My parents like kids that study a lot. But even then I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stay too long in front of my copybooks. If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong and not study beforehand. I did homeworks that was asked at school. Of course I never sacrificed my weekends to do them. I will always do them a day or two before the class but I still did them. A nice felling at school is when you get your homework right and get to go to the board and solve it for the whole class.\nAs time went on, what I like about subjects changed. In elementary school, I liked drawing and natural science (Biology, Earth). In college, I sitll liked natural sciences (Living and non Living), but I still didn\u0026rsquo;t like Maths. When we started Physics and Chemistry, I told myself I had to like it, because I always heard my older siblings talk about it and I felt like I was missing out. I only started to like Maths in my 4th year of college. The story that lead to that is a bit dramatic and I will skip that. In High school, same scenario, I started to study Philosphy and I told myseld I had to like because of me finally getting in the grown up closed circle. As a matter of fact I liked Philosophy a lot, I also like continued liking Physics, Chemistry and Maths and that helped me a lot in putting more focus during class. Finally I never stopped liking natural science. I hardly failed one test about genetics which hit me hard than I thought, because natural science has always been my greatest point. I liked sports, it\u0026rsquo;s outdoor.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t like History and Geography. These two subject where given by the same teacher. I think maybe that not liking history as lead me to not like Geography. When I went to university I thought to myself that they don\u0026rsquo;t teach us history properly. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like French classes, especially in elementary school, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t grasp it to how other kids could understant all these difficult things about coordination, relative subjects, especially this one. I was not good in English and I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it either, I felt like the only thing I learnt from English is a long list of verbs.\n","permalink":"https://soscler.github.io/posts/what-did-i-like-at-school/","summary":"Not study, not books, but people and playing","title":"What Did I Like at School"},{"content":" Here is a list of books that I have read and liked.\nBooks from Ted Chiang The Merchant and the Alchemist\u0026rsquo;s\nExhalation\nThe Lifecycle of Software Objects\nThe Great Silence\nAnxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom\nTower of Babylone\nUnderstand\nDivision by Zero\nStory of Your Life\nHell is the Absence of God\nI enjoy reading Ted Chiang a lot, maybe I get that from liking tech related stuff. Ted Chiang likes to take his inspiration from Scientific Topics, and most usually come from complex ones. One good thing I also like from of his books, they are short and can be read in one night or longer if you are a slow reader like me.\nI liked Story of Your Life and Others a lot. I had watched the movie Arrival a long time before getting to know it was from Ted\u0026rsquo;s Chaing book. The movie was really good, and unlike many Sci-Fi movies, I felt like this had more realism into it. I could easily relate the langage as an obstacle in understanding each other and creating a good relationship. Also in the movie the Aliens where not seen as foreign entities coming and creating wars and gathering all goods they can get from the locals, instead their objective was more subtle, unknown I would say. Until the end I didn\u0026rsquo;t get the purpose of the Aliens coming on Earth. I still believe there should be a follow up. But many told me it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like there should be.\nLong after watching the movie, I got to read the book Story of Your Life and Other on a recommentation of my girlfriend. After reading the book I was so surprised on how the movie reflected as almost as perfect the story in the book.\nWhat mental pictures do I create from books\nDevotion of the Suspect X This book didn\u0026rsquo;t have many characters in it so it was relatively easier to keep track of people faces I created in my mind. But what strikes me until today and after 3 years, is how I still have some mental pictures of scenes in my mind.For example this scene where the main characther walks by a bridge where homeless people gathered. Something intense related to that scene would happen later, but I will not talk about that here.\nAu revoir la haut In this book about World War I, I mostly create mental pictures of the main characthers. The Author is so descriptive in his writting that creating metal pictures is so easily. One strange sensation I never got from no other book is a mental odour, or perfume. At one point in the book the author where described how an injured soldiers wounds started to rot and I can tell you I almost got a mental smell from that. I am not even sure if mental smell is a thing but I sensed something.\nMemoirs from a Geisha While reading this book, I was mostly able to pictures the clothings. A great focus was put on the clothings by the author, as Kimonos takes a great place and value in a Geisha life. When the other gives small details and sometime link these details to greater things in the nature like a forest or river, I easily pictured how the clothes looked like.\nI have already seen some pictures from Japan with Cherry Blossoming, Pink flowers on the snow. I also saw many pictures about Zen culture (Bamboo, Water flowing, etc.). Finally I watched lot of Japanese animes.\nUsually when I read a book I create mental images of the story, characters, houses, clothes, etc.\n","permalink":"https://soscler.github.io/books/book-i-have-read/","summary":"Here is a list of books that I have read and liked.\nBooks from Ted Chiang The Merchant and the Alchemist\u0026rsquo;s\nExhalation\nThe Lifecycle of Software Objects\nThe Great Silence\nAnxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom\nTower of Babylone\nUnderstand\nDivision by Zero\nStory of Your Life\nHell is the Absence of God\nI enjoy reading Ted Chiang a lot, maybe I get that from liking tech related stuff.
